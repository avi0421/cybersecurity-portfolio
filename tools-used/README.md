# 🛠️ Tools Used in My Cybersecurity Learning Journey

This folder contains documentation and examples of the key cybersecurity tools I have learned and used during the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program. These tools help with monitoring, analysis, threat detection, and automation.

## 🔍 Security Tools

- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**  
  Tools like Splunk and IBM QRadar help collect and analyze security event data in real-time.

- **Packet Sniffers (Network Protocol Analyzers)**  
  Example: Wireshark – Used to capture and analyze network traffic for potential vulnerabilities or unusual activity.

- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**  
  Example: Snort – Detects malicious network activity and sends alerts.

- **Antivirus/Anti-malware Software**  
  Helps prevent, detect, and remove known threats like viruses, worms, and ransomware.

## 💻 Programming and Query Tools

- **Python**  
  Used to automate repetitive security tasks such as log parsing, scanning, or alert generation.

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**  
  Used to extract, filter, and analyze data from large databases to identify anomalies.

## 🖥️ Operating Systems

- **Linux (Ubuntu, Kali, etc.)**  
  Open-source OS commonly used in cybersecurity for command-line operations, file permissions, and log analysis.

## 🌐 Other Utilities

- **OWASP ZAP**  
  An open-source web vulnerability scanner used to find flaws in web applications.

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Version control system and hosting platform to track changes in scripts, tools, or documentation.
